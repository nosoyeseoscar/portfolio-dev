# The portfolio of Oscar Fuentes

Here I showcase projects where I demonstrate the technologies I know, what I am capable of doing, and above all, what I have learned self-taught out of sheer hunger for knowledge. If something you're looking for isn't here, don't worry, I'm probably learning it right now.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Site Assets
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Astro components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
